                are a celestial phenomenom that occurs when the Moon  passes between the Sun and the Earth, causing some or all light to be blocked. If light is completely blocked, 
                then it is known as <strong>total solar eclipse</strong> (or simply solar eclipse). Otherwise, it is known as a <strong>partial solar eclipse.</strong>

                Lunar eclipses
                </a>
                are also a phenomenom involving the same three celestial bodies present during during solar eclipses - the Sun, the Earth, and the Moon. Instead of the moon covering 
                the light emitting from the Sun, lunar eclipses occur when the Moon moves into the Earth's shadow. This causes the moon to appear to turn a red-ish hue. Also similar
                to solar eclipses is the existence of both <strong>total lunar eclipses</strong> and <strong>partial lunar eclipses.</strong>
